# How to Contribute
Do you have a code challenge idea you'd like to add? Submit a Pull Request and your challenge will be evaluated for inclusion.

## What makes a good challenge?
- A good starting point is to look at job postings for entry-level Drupal developer positions to see what skills and experience are desired.
- Design a code challenge that provides opportunities to build and demonstrate the skills and experience.
- Review current code challenges as an example of how to define your challenge.
- Provide a GitHub project board that can be used as a starting point, as if each issue were assigned to a junior developer.
