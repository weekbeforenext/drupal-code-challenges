## Goal
Our goal is to provide code challenges, or project ideas, for novice developers to build and demonstrate Drupal development skills.

The end results of completing these code challenges can be used as portfolio items or code samples when applying for jobs.

## How does this work?
The challenges are designed to feel like a real-world projects - documented and tasked by a lead developer for junior developers.

They can be completed alone, with a mentor, or with a team of developers.

Each challenge includes a GitHub project board that can be copied as a starting point with draft issues.

## Contribution
Do you have a code challenge idea you'd like to add? Submit a Pull Request and your challenge will be evaluated for inclusion.

### What makes a good challenge?
- A good starting point is to look at job postings for entry-level Drupal developer positions to see what skills and experience are desired.
- Design a code challenge that provides opportunities to build and demonstrate the skills and experience.
- Review current code challenges as an example of how to define your challenge.
- Provide a GitHub project board that can be used as a starting point, as if each issue were assigned to a junior developer.
