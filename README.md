## Goal
Our goal is to provide code challenges, or project ideas, for novice developers to build and demonstrate Drupal development skills.

The end results of completing these code challenges can be used as portfolio items or code samples when applying for jobs.

## How does this work?
The challenges are designed to feel like a real-world projects - documented and tasked by a lead developer for junior developers.

They can be completed alone, with a mentor, or with a team of developers.

Each challenge includes a GitHub project board that can be copied as a starting point with draft issues.

## How can I test code challenge solutions?

A Drupal test site repository is available in the [drupal-code-challenges-test](https://github.com/weekbeforenext/drupal-code-challenges-test) project. This repository is configured to run locally with [DDEV](https://ddev.com/), integrate with [Tugboat](https://www.tugboatqa.com/), and includes custom DDEV commands to add GitHub project modules to composer.
