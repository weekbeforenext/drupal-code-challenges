## Objective
Build a Drupal 10+-compatible module that installs a content model and populates a site with data from a third-party API when installed. Provide documentation for the content model and module.

### Requirements
1. Content model documentation.
1. Custom Drupal 10 compatible module code exists in a public repository (i.e. GitHub).
1. When the custom module is installed on a Drupal site it:
    1. Installs any dependent core or contributed modules.
    1. Installs configuration related to and matching the content model.
    1. Installs migration configuration.
    1. Runs the migration(s) to import the data from a third-party API.
1. The custom module includes a README.md file documenting the following:
    1. What the module does.
    1. Installation instructions.
    1. Testing instructions (step-by-step how to verify the module works as expected).
    1. Link to the content model documentation.
    1. Other information someone should know before they install the module.
   1. Link to the project management tool used to develop the module.
1. The custom module code includes code comments.
1. The custom module follows Drupal Coding Standards.

## Getting Started
To demonstrate your written communication, task management, and documentation skills, create a public project management board to track your progress and document your journey.

Copy the provided [Drupal Code Challenges: API Migration](https://github.com/users/weekbeforenext/projects/2/views/1) GitHub project board with draft issues as a suggested starting point.
- [Copying an existing project](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/creating-projects/copying-an-existing-project)

Once copied, convert all of the draft issues into issues.
- [Converting draft issues to issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/managing-items-in-your-project/converting-draft-issues-to-issues#converting-draft-issues-in-board-layout)

### Project Workflow
- Pick up tasks from the top of the "Todo" column and move it to the "In Progress" column.
- When you complete the task, move it to the "Done" column.

### Issue Management
- Create additional issues as needed to break down large tasks into smaller ones.
- Before you step away from an issue, leave comments on the issues to document:
    - what you did (helpful links, things that worked, things that didn't work)
    - what you plan to do next
- Bulleted lists and headings help make your comments easier to read and understand when you return to the issue.
